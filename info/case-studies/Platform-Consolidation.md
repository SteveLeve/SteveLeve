# **Case Study 3: Platform Consolidation Across Awin Global**

**Summary:** I guided the consolidation of two major affiliate platforms, protecting revenue and customer trust during one of the company’s most complex transitions.

When Awin Global acquired ShareASale, the decision was made to sunset our platform and consolidate everything into Awin’s global system. On paper, it was simple: migrate 250,000 publishers and 10,000 merchants. In reality, it meant reconciling years of custom features, fragile workflows, and mission-critical systems — all without disrupting the revenue streams our customers relied on.

The challenges were immense. Tracking, which powered the majority of revenue, needed to continue seamlessly during the transition. Transaction processing had to achieve near-feature parity with attribution logic built over decades. And merchants depended on legacy workflows like FTP uploads that had no direct counterpart in Awin’s systems.

Working closely with executives and distributed teams, I helped design the consolidation strategy. We built interim solutions like a Cloudflare-based tracking proxy that protected 99.5\% of revenue, a relay service to bridge transaction processors, and a temporary FTP synchronization system so merchants could keep working without disruption. Meanwhile, I co-led customer account migrations, mapping schemas and workflows while aligning teams on both sides of the Atlantic.

The result was a remarkably smooth transition. Customers logged in, accepted new terms, and continued doing business. Revenue was protected, costs were optimized, and the consolidation finished on schedule. For me, it was proof that with the right mix of technical ingenuity and cross-functional alignment, even the most daunting migrations can succeed.
