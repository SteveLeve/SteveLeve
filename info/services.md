# Services

I work with companies that need senior technical capability without the overhead of a full-time executive hire—or teams building AI applications that need to actually ship.

## AI Application Development

**From prototype to production.**

Most AI demos don't survive contact with real users. I build applications with the reliability, observability, and operational maturity that production demands.

**What I deliver:**
- Production RAG systems with sub-second latency and streaming responses
- Multi-LLM architectures (OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source models)
- Custom evaluation frameworks that measure quality, not just vibes
- Platform-flexible deployment (Vercel, Cloudflare Workers, AWS)
- Full-stack integration with authentication, rate limiting, cost controls

**Recent work:** Shipped 4 production RAG systems in December 2025, including two live public demos. Built custom evaluation framework achieving +15% precision improvement through systematic testing and measurement.

**Evidence:**
- [Vercel RAG Demo](https://vercel-rag-demo.stevenleve.com) — Production chatbot with semantic search (live)
- [Cloudflare RAG Demo](https://cloudflare-rag-demo.stevenleve.com) — Edge-deployed with on-device LLM inference (live)
- ~5,000+ lines of production Python and TypeScript
- Custom metrics framework (not RAGAS) with ground-truth datasets

*Best for: Teams building AI features who need someone who's shipped production AI applications, not just completed tutorials.*

## Technical Leadership

**Strategic guidance without the full-time commitment.**

Fractional CTO and advisory services for companies navigating technical complexity. I help with the decisions that are hard to undo—architecture choices, team structure, technology bets.

**What I offer:**
- Fractional CTO / interim technical leadership
- Architecture review and technology strategy
- Engineering team mentoring and growth planning
- Enterprise architecture and roadmap development
- Technical due diligence for M&A or investment

**Current engagement:** Serving as Fractional CTO for stealth MarTech startup—shipped beta product to early customers with positive feedback. 2x weekly meetings plus async code review and strategic guidance.

**Background:** 17+ years leading technical teams through acquisitions, migrations, and transformations. Scaled engineering teams (8 to 25+ engineers), established governance frameworks, led AI adoption initiatives.

*Best for: Startups needing senior technical leadership, companies in transition, or teams facing architectural decisions with long-term consequences.*

## Marketing Technology

**Deep expertise in revenue-critical MarTech infrastructure.**

17 years building affiliate marketing platforms at ShareASale/Awin Global. I understand tracking, attribution, payments, and the systems that power partner marketing at scale.

**What I know:**
- Affiliate and partner marketing platform architecture
- Tracking systems and attribution (250M+ monthly requests)
- Transaction processing and payment systems ($1B+ annual volume)
- Publisher/merchant relationship management at scale
- AI opportunities in MarTech (attribution, optimization, intelligence)

**Track record:** Built platforms serving 250K+ publishers and 10K+ merchants. Led platform consolidations protecting 99.5% of revenue. Designed tracking integrations with 263ms latency improvement and 75% error rate reduction.

**Current work:** Fractional CTO for stealth MarTech startup focused on partner ecosystem management.

*Best for: MarTech companies building affiliate, partner, or advertising platforms—or anyone acquiring/integrating marketing technology assets.*

## Cloud Strategy & Cost Optimization

**Stop paying for resources you don't need.**

Data-driven cloud optimization reducing costs without compromising performance or reliability. I've delivered 25% AWS reduction and 50% DataDog reduction in production environments.

**What I deliver:**
- Cloud cost optimization assessment (identify 20-40% waste)
- Observability & logging strategy (reduce costs, improve signal)
- Edge computing evaluation (Cloudflare Workers, CDN, edge inference)
- AI & LLM cost optimization (model selection, caching, edge inference)
- Cloud governance & security (compliance, FinOps, cost controls)

**Proven results:**
- 25% AWS reduction while maintaining 99.95%+ uptime
- 50% DataDog reduction while improving observability
- $20,000+ monthly sustained savings
- Recent edge computing work: 90%+ cost reduction for suitable AI workloads

**Modern expertise:** Edge computing (Cloudflare Workers), AI cost optimization, FinOps practices, infrastructure as code (Terraform).

*Best for: Companies spending $10K+/month on cloud with suspected waste, teams exploring edge computing, or anyone building AI features with unpredictable costs.*

## Legacy System Modernization & Migration

**From legacy to modern, without breaking what works.**

Pragmatic modernization that protects your business while unlocking new capabilities. 25+ years experience with zero-downtime migrations and incremental refactoring.

**What I deliver:**
- Legacy system assessment & modernization roadmap
- Cloud migration (AWS) with zero-downtime strategies
- Monolith to microservices decomposition (when appropriate)
- Technology stack upgrades (ColdFusion, legacy .NET, older Java → modern stacks)
- AI integration into legacy systems (add AI value without rewriting everything)

**Innovation:** AI-augmented modernization achieving 2-3x development velocity through agentic coding tools (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Kiro). 4-6x acceleration on refactoring through AI assistance.

**Track record:**
- Zero-downtime AWS migration protecting $1B+ transactions
- Multi-year platform consolidation (4 acquired companies)
- 99.95%+ uptime maintained throughout transformations
- ColdFusion → Node.js migrations, legacy .NET → modern .NET

*Best for: Companies with critical legacy systems that need modernization, but business continuity is non-negotiable. Organizations open to AI-augmented development for faster delivery.*

## How I Work

**Engagements typically start with a conversation** to understand what you're trying to accomplish and whether I'm the right fit. I'm direct about what I can and can't help with.

**Flexibility matters.** Some clients need a few hours of architecture review. Others need embedded leadership for months. I structure engagements around outcomes, not billable hours.

**I'm also open to full-time roles** for the right opportunity—particularly AI Engineering positions where I can combine my infrastructure background with production AI development, or CTO/VP Engineering roles for companies building interesting things.
