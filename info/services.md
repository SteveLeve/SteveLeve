# Services

I work with companies that need senior technical capability without the overhead of a full-time executive hire—or teams building AI applications that need to actually ship.

## AI Application Development

**From prototype to production.**

Most AI demos don't survive contact with real users. I build applications with the reliability, observability, and operational maturity that production demands.

**What I deliver:**
- RAG systems with sub-second latency and streaming responses
- Multi-LLM architectures (OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source models)
- Custom evaluation frameworks that measure quality, not just vibes
- Production deployment across platforms (Vercel, Cloudflare Workers, traditional cloud)
- Vector database design and optimization

**Recent work:** Shipped 4 production RAG systems in December 2025, including two live demos. Built custom evaluation framework achieving +15% precision improvement through systematic testing.

*Best for: Teams building AI features who need someone who's shipped production AI applications, not just completed tutorials.*

## Technical Leadership

**Strategic guidance without the full-time commitment.**

Fractional CTO and advisory services for companies navigating technical complexity. I help with the decisions that are hard to undo—architecture choices, team structure, technology bets.

**What I offer:**
- Fractional CTO / interim technical leadership
- Architecture review and technology strategy
- Engineering team mentoring and growth planning
- Enterprise architecture and roadmap development
- Technical due diligence for M&A or investment

**Background:** 17+ years leading technical teams through acquisitions, migrations, and transformations. Scaled engineering teams, established governance frameworks, led AI adoption initiatives.

*Best for: Startups needing senior technical leadership, companies in transition, or teams facing architectural decisions with long-term consequences.*

## Marketing Technology

**Deep expertise in revenue-critical MarTech infrastructure.**

17 years building affiliate marketing platforms at ShareASale/Awin Global. I understand tracking, attribution, payments, and the systems that power partner marketing at scale.

**What I know:**
- Affiliate and partner marketing platform architecture
- Tracking systems and attribution (250M+ monthly requests)
- Transaction processing and payment systems ($1B+ annual volume)
- Publisher/merchant relationship management at scale
- AdTech integrations and campaign management

**Track record:** Built platforms serving 250K+ publishers and 10K+ merchants. Led platform consolidations protecting 99.5% of revenue. Designed tracking integrations with 263ms latency and 75% error rate reduction.

*Best for: MarTech companies building affiliate, partner, or advertising platforms—or anyone acquiring/integrating marketing technology assets.*

## How I Work

**Engagements typically start with a conversation** to understand what you're trying to accomplish and whether I'm the right fit. I'm direct about what I can and can't help with.

**Flexibility matters.** Some clients need a few hours of architecture review. Others need embedded leadership for months. I structure engagements around outcomes, not billable hours.

**I'm also open to full-time roles** for the right opportunity—particularly AI Engineering positions where I can combine my infrastructure background with production AI development.
