# About Me

## Infrastructure Roots. AI Focus. Shipping Mentality.

I spent two decades building the systems that power the web—data center migrations, cloud transformations, platforms processing billions in transactions. I learned that reliability isn't just about uptime; it's about trust.

Now I apply that same engineering rigor to AI. The field is full of demos that impress but don't ship. I build production systems with the observability, security, and operational maturity that comes from years of being on-call for revenue-critical infrastructure.

## What Sets Me Apart

**I Ship**
Recent work: 4 production RAG systems built and deployed in under a week. Two are live right now with streaming responses and sub-second latency. I don't just prototype; I deliver.

**I Measure**
I built a custom evaluation framework for RAG quality—not off-the-shelf tools, but ground-truth datasets and metrics (Precision@K, Recall, MRR, NDCG) that drive systematic improvement. Measured results: +15% precision, +22% overall quality.

**I Understand the Full Stack**
From GPU hardware to React frontends, I know how the pieces fit together. My AI work is grounded in platform engineering experience that most AI practitioners lack.

**I Know Context Engineering**
I've spent months exploring how to make AI tools genuinely useful for development teams. The `CLAUDE.md` files, structured data patterns, and workflow designs that turn generic LLMs into specialized assistants—I've mapped this territory and can help teams navigate it.

## Background

**17 Years at ShareASale/Awin Global**
Built and scaled affiliate marketing infrastructure serving 250K+ publishers and 10K+ merchants. Led platform consolidations, zero-downtime migrations, and the kind of crisis response that happens at 3 AM when transactions can't drop.

**Technical Leadership**
Scaled engineering teams, established DevSecOps practices, and led AI governance initiatives. Currently serving as Fractional CTO for a stealth MarTech startup.

**Credentials**
- AWS Certified AI Practitioner (2025-2028)
- B.A., Studio Art — Western Illinois University
