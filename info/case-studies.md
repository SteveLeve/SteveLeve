## AI Application Development

### [Production RAG Systems: Multi-Platform Experimental Lab](case-studies/production-rag-systems.md)

**Challenge:** Building deployable AI consulting capabilities requires more than theoretical knowledge—clients need consultants who can deploy immediately on diverse platforms, evaluate trade-offs with data, and optimize systematically.

**What I Built:** Multi-platform RAG experimental unit enabling systematic comparison of AI architectures, platforms, and techniques. Created production-ready implementations on Vercel, Cloudflare Workers, and local Jupyter environments as controlled labs for evaluating cost, performance, and quality trade-offs. Built with simple, open-source stack to maintain proximity to fundamentals—providing perspective when evaluating higher-abstraction platforms like AWS Bedrock or Azure AI Foundry.

**Key Results:**
- **2 live production demos** ([Vercel](https://vercel-rag-demo.stevenleve.com), [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare-rag-demo.stevenleve.com)) showcasing different architectural approaches
- **Custom evaluation framework** with ground-truth curation for systematic improvement
- **Measured optimization:** +15% Precision (reranking), +22% quality (semantic chunking), +18% NDCG (hybrid search)
- **Platform comparison insights:** 90%+ cost reduction possible, informed hosting recommendations
- **~5,000+ lines** production-quality code with reusable patterns for rapid client deployment

**Value Proposition:** Demonstrates balanced mastery of **Accuracy** (engineering trade-offs), **Precision** (measured optimization), and **Speed** (efficient development)—the foundations for effective AI consulting.
