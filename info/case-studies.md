## From Strategy to Execution

Real-world examples of how pragmatic, reliability-first thinking solves critical business challenges.

**Track Record:** 25+ years delivering results across enterprise platforms • Zero-downtime cloud migrations • 99.5% revenue protected during platform consolidations • Production AI applications with sub-second latency • Crisis-tested under the most demanding conditions

## Featured Case Studies

### AI & Emerging Technologies

**[Data Center Exit Under Austerity](case-studies/Data-Center-Exit.md)** — 12 months to exit a closing data center. 20 undocumented servers. No budget for consultants. Zero tolerance for downtime. I reverse-engineered the entire infrastructure using PowerShell scripts, designed a phased migration to VMware, and executed it ahead of schedule with **zero revenue loss**. *Key takeaway: When you can't afford consultants, automation and documentation become your force multipliers.*

**[AWS Migration & Modernization](case-studies/AWS-Migration.md)** — Six months. One chance to get it right. Led the complete migration from managed hosting to AWS while managing external consultants, modernizing observability (DataDog, CloudWatch), and introducing DevSecOps practices. Delivered on time with **zero downtime**—and transformed how the organization approaches infrastructure. *Key takeaway: Successful migrations combine technical execution with culture change.*

### Platform Strategy & Consolidation

**[Platform Consolidation Across Awin Global](case-studies/Platform-Consolidation.md)** — Merging two major affiliate platforms serving 250,000 publishers and 10,000 merchants. Legacy tracking handling 250M monthly requests that couldn't drop a single conversion. Built a multi-layer proxy architecture (Cloudflare Workers + AWS Lambda) that protected **99.5% of revenue** and reduced error rates by **75%**. *Key takeaway: Complex migrations succeed when you build bridges, not walls—interim solutions buy time for doing it right.*

**[Production RAG Application with Sub-Second Latency](case-studies/AI-RAG-Application.md)** — Built a production-ready RAG application that lets users chat with their data in real-time. Full-stack AI engineering across FastAPI, React, vector databases, and multiple LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama) with sub-second response times. *Key takeaway: Practical AI implementation requires benchmarking—local models hit 15-30s latency; cloud APIs achieved sub-second TTFT.*

**[Open-Source Intel GPU LLM Benchmarking Framework](case-studies/LLM-Benchmarking-Framework.md)** — Created an open-source framework to systematically evaluate LLM performance on consumer hardware. Achieved 2-4x speedup with Intel GPU acceleration. Provides the data you need to make informed build-vs-buy decisions for AI inference. *Key takeaway: Quantization matters—Q4 offers 40% speed gains over Q8 with minimal quality loss.*

### Cloud Architecture & Security

**[Secure Edge Computing Platform on Cloudflare](case-studies/Secure-Edge-Deployment.md)** — Transformed a basic website (19% security score) into a fortress (96%) using Cloudflare Workers, edge compute, and serverless architecture. Sub-100ms response times globally with near-zero running costs. *Key takeaway: Edge computing + serverless delivers enterprise-grade security and performance at a fraction of traditional costs.*
