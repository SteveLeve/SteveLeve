# Steve Leve | Reliability-First Modernization

## Engineering the Future of AI.

Bridging the gap between enterprise infrastructure and production AI applications. From RAG architectures to edge computing, I build systems that deliver real business value.

### AI Engineering with Infrastructure Roots

I’m a senior technologist with 25+ years of experience pivoting to the forefront of AI Engineering. I combine deep infrastructure expertise (SRE, Cloud, DevOps) with modern AI capabilities to build production-grade applications. I don't just prototype; I engineer systems that are secure, scalable, and observable.

### How I Help

*   **AI Application Development:** Building custom RAG applications, integrating LLMs, and designing vector search systems that solve specific business problems with sub-second latency.

*   **Strategic Modernization:** Helping organizations transition from legacy infrastructure to modern, AI-ready platforms. I bring a pragmatic approach to cloud migration, edge computing, and digital transformation.

*   **Technical Leadership:** Providing fractional CTO and advisory services to guide teams through the complexities of the modern tech stack, from API design to security compliance.

### Current Initiatives

*   **[Production RAG Application](./case-studies/AI-RAG-Application.md):** A full-stack application enabling real-time chat with data, featuring sub-second latency and multi-LLM support.
*   **[Intel GPU LLM Benchmarking](./case-studies/LLM-Benchmarking-Framework.md):** Open-source framework for analyzing local LLM performance on consumer hardware.
*   **[Secure Edge Platform](./case-studies/Secure-Edge-Deployment.md):** Enterprise-grade secure website deployed on Cloudflare Workers with 96% security score.
