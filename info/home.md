# Steve Leve | Reliability-First Modernization

## Engineering the Future of AI.

Bridging the gap between enterprise infrastructure and production AI applications. From RAG architectures to edge computing, I build systems that deliver real business value.

### AI Engineering with Infrastructure Roots

I’m a senior technologist with 25+ years of experience pivoting to the forefront of AI Engineering. I combine deep infrastructure expertise (SRE, Cloud, DevOps) with modern AI capabilities to build production-grade applications. I don't just prototype; I engineer systems that are secure, scalable, and observable.

### How I Help

*   **AI Application Development:** Building custom RAG applications with production deployment across platforms (Vercel, Cloudflare Workers, traditional cloud). Sub-second latency, streaming responses, multi-LLM support, and evaluation frameworks.

*   **Strategic Modernization:** Helping organizations transition from legacy infrastructure to modern, AI-ready platforms. I bring a pragmatic approach to cloud migration, edge computing, and digital transformation.

*   **Technical Leadership:** Providing fractional CTO and advisory services to guide teams through the complexities of the modern tech stack, from API design to security compliance.

### Live Demos

*   **[Vercel RAG Demo](https://vercel-rag-demo.stevenleve.com):** Production streaming chatbot with semantic search. Built with Next.js 16, React 19, OpenAI GPT-4o, Neon PostgreSQL (pgvector), and Vercel AI SDK. Features sub-second response times and 100+ document corpus.
*   **[Cloudflare Workers RAG Demo](https://cloudflare-rag-demo.stevenleve.com):** Edge-deployed RAG system with on-device LLM inference (Llama-3.1-8B). Built with Cloudflare Workers, Hono, Vectorize, D1, R2, and KV. Zero external API calls, optimized for global latency.

### Recent Projects

*   **[RAG Evaluation Lab](https://github.com/SteveLeve/rag_wiki_demo):** Custom metrics framework for systematic RAG quality improvement using Precision@K, Recall, MRR, NDCG, BLEU, and ROUGE. Achieved measured improvements through experimentation with reranking, semantic chunking, and query expansion.
*   **[Intel GPU LLM Benchmarking](./case-studies/LLM-Benchmarking-Framework.md):** Open-source framework for analyzing local LLM performance on consumer hardware.
*   **[Secure Edge Platform](./case-studies/Secure-Edge-Deployment.md):** Enterprise-grade secure website deployed on Cloudflare Workers with 96% security score.
