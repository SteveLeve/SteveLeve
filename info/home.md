# Steve Leve | AI Engineering & Technical Leadership

## Building Production AI Applications on Solid Foundations

I combine 25+ years of platform engineering expertise with modern AI capabilities to build systems that deliver real business value. From RAG architectures to edge computing, I engineer applications that are secure, scalable, and observable—not just prototypes that demo well.

---

## What I Do

**AI Application Development**
Production-ready RAG systems, LLM integrations, and evaluation frameworks. I build AI applications that ship—with sub-second latency, streaming responses, and the instrumentation to know when something breaks.

**Technical Leadership**
Fractional CTO and advisory services for companies navigating technical complexity. Architecture decisions, team mentoring, and the strategic perspective that comes from building and scaling platforms over two decades.

**Marketing Technology**
Deep expertise in affiliate marketing, tracking systems, and revenue-critical MarTech infrastructure. 17 years building platforms that processed $1B+ in annual transactions.

## Live Demos

See the work, not just the words.

**[Vercel RAG Demo](https://vercel-rag-demo.stevenleve.com)**
Production streaming chatbot with semantic search. Next.js 16, React 19, OpenAI GPT-4o, Neon PostgreSQL (pgvector). Sub-second responses across 100+ document corpus.

**[Cloudflare Workers RAG Demo](https://cloudflare-rag-demo.stevenleve.com)**
Edge-deployed RAG with on-device LLM inference (Llama-3.1-8B). Zero external API calls, optimized for global latency. Built on Cloudflare Workers, Vectorize, D1, R2.

## Recent Work

**Production RAG Systems** — Shipped 4 RAG applications in December 2025, including the live demos above. Full-stack AI engineering across multiple platforms with custom evaluation frameworks.

**Custom Evaluation Framework** — Built metrics-driven RAG quality improvement using Precision@K, Recall, MRR, NDCG. Achieved +15% precision and +22% overall quality through systematic experimentation.

**Fractional CTO Engagement** — Providing technical leadership for a stealth MarTech startup, shipping beta product to early customers.
