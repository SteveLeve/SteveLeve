# Professional Service Offering: Cloud Strategy & Cost Optimization

## Stop Paying for Resources You Don't Need

Your cloud bill is steadily increasing, but are you getting proportional value? Most companies overspend on cloud infrastructure by 30-50% through oversized resources, idle instances, inefficient architecture, and expensive observability tools.

I help you optimize your cloud strategy, improve governance, and significantly reduce spending—without compromising performance, security, or reliability.

## Service Offerings

### 1. Cloud Cost Optimization Assessment

**Situation:** Your cloud bill is steadily increasing, and you're not sure why. You suspect you're overspending but don't know where to cut costs.

**Our Solution:** Deep-dive analysis of your cloud usage and spending using tools like AWS Trusted Advisor, AWS Cost Explorer, and third-party platforms.

**We Identify:**
- **Oversized Resources** — Instances running at <20% utilization
- **Idle Resources** — Development/test environments running 24/7
- **Inefficient Storage** — Unoptimized data storage and backup strategies
- **Network Waste** — Unnecessary data transfer costs
- **Reserved Instance Gaps** — Missing savings opportunities
- **Zombie Resources** — Forgotten instances and services
- **Architectural Inefficiencies** — Better architectures for less cost

**Deliverable:** Prioritized list of actionable recommendations with:
- Expected cost savings per recommendation
- Implementation effort and risk assessment
- Quick wins (<1 week) vs. long-term improvements
- Business impact analysis

**Typical Results:** 20-40% cost reduction identified, with 10-15% achievable in first 30 days.

### 2. Observability & Logging Strategy

**Situation:** You're paying a fortune for observability and logging tools (DataDog, Splunk, New Relic), but you're not getting the insights you need. Your logs are noisy, and your alerts are not actionable.

**Our Solution:** Cost-effective observability strategy that improves signal while reducing cost.

**We Implement:**
- **Log Filtering** — Eliminate noisy logs that don't inform decisions
- **Sampling Strategies** — Collect representative data without 100% ingestion
- **Metric Optimization** — Track what matters, not everything possible
- **Alert Tuning** — Reduce false positives, improve actionability
- **Custom Dashboards** — Business-relevant metrics, not vanity metrics
- **Cost Attribution** — Understand who/what drives observability costs

**Proven Results:**
- 50% DataDog cost reduction at ShareASale
- Faster incident detection despite reduced data volume
- More actionable alerts (less noise)
- Better business metric visibility

**Philosophy:** You don't need to log everything—you need to log the right things. More data ≠ better insights.

### 3. Edge Computing & Modern Architecture

**Situation:** You're paying for global infrastructure you might not need, or your latency isn't meeting user expectations despite high costs.

**Our Solution:** Evaluate edge computing alternatives for cost and performance optimization.

**Edge Opportunities:**
- **Cloudflare Workers** — Global deployment with near-zero latency
- **Edge Caching** — Reduce origin load and costs
- **Edge Compute** — Run logic close to users without traditional servers
- **Serverless at Edge** — Pay only for actual usage
- **Static Asset Optimization** — CDN and edge delivery strategies

**Recent Experience:** Built production RAG applications on Cloudflare Workers:
- Broad model selection with Workers AI
- Sub-100ms global latency
- 90%+ cost reduction vs. traditional cloud deployment
- Scales automatically without manual intervention

**When Edge Makes Sense:**
- Global user base with latency requirements
- Read-heavy workloads (caching opportunities)
- Static or semi-static content
- APIs with predictable patterns
- AI features that can run on smaller models

### 4. AI & LLM Cost Optimization

**Situation:** You're building AI features but costs are unpredictable and growing faster than value delivered.

**Our Solution:** Practical strategies for controlling LLM and AI infrastructure costs based on recent production experience.

**Cost Optimization Strategies:**
- **Model Selection** — Right-size models for use cases (GPT-4o vs. GPT-4o-mini vs. open source)
- **Prompt Engineering** — Reduce token usage while improving results
- **Caching Strategies** — Avoid redundant API calls
- **Edge Inference** — Run smaller models locally or at edge
- **Batch Processing** — Process lower-priority work efficiently
- **Request Throttling** — Prevent cost spirals from abuse
- **Quality Monitoring** — Ensure cost cuts don't degrade quality

**Recent Portfolio Work:**
- Compared Vercel (OpenAI) vs. Cloudflare Workers (local inference)
- Built evaluation frameworks to measure quality vs. cost tradeoffs
- Demonstrated 90%+ cost reduction for suitable use cases

**Typical Findings:**
- 30-50% cost reduction through model selection
- 20-30% reduction through prompt optimization
- 60-90% reduction through edge inference (where applicable)
- Unpredictable costs → predictable costs through architecture

### 5. Cloud Governance & Security

**Situation:** You're concerned about the security and compliance of your cloud environment. You need to ensure you're following best practices and meeting regulatory requirements (ISO 27001, NIST, SOC 2).

**Our Solution:** Establish robust cloud governance framework aligned with business requirements.

**We Implement:**
- **Security Policies** — IAM best practices, least privilege access
- **Compliance Controls** — Automated checks for regulatory requirements
- **Cost Controls** — Budgets, alerts, approval workflows
- **Tagging Strategy** — Resource organization and cost attribution
- **Automated Enforcement** — Policy-as-code, guardrails
- **Audit & Reporting** — Visibility for compliance and governance

**Compliance Experience:**
- SOC 2 audit support for financial platforms
- GDPR compliance for tracking systems
- PCI-DSS for payment processing systems
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### 6. FinOps & Cloud Financial Management

**Situation:** You want to create a culture of cost-consciousness within your engineering teams. You need to make cloud spending a shared responsibility.

**Our Solution:** Implement FinOps principles and practices to empower teams.

**We Establish:**
- **Cost Visibility** — Dashboards showing spending by team/service/environment
- **Budget Ownership** — Teams own their cloud costs
- **Forecasting** — Predictable cost growth tied to business metrics
- **Cost-Aware Development** — Engineers understand cost implications
- **Optimization Incentives** — Reward teams for cost-conscious decisions
- **Regular Reviews** — Monthly cost reviews with actionable insights

**Cultural Change:**
- From "not my problem" to shared responsibility
- From reactive cost management to proactive optimization
- From annual budget shocks to continuous improvement
