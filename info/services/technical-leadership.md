# Professional Service Offering: Technical Leadership & Strategy

## Experienced Leadership Without the Full-Time Commitment

Organizations need senior technical leadership to guide engineering teams, define technology strategy, and drive business results. But hiring a full-time CTO or VP of Engineering isn't always the right move—especially for startups, companies in transition, or teams facing temporary leadership gaps.

I provide fractional or interim technical leadership with 20+ years of experience building and scaling platforms that process billions in transactions.

## Why Choose Me?

### Strategic Systems Thinker, Hands-On Executor

I don't just advise from the sidelines. My current fractional CTO engagement has me in the code, reviewing PRs, and making architectural decisions. My recent AI portfolio demonstrates I can ship production systems, not just talk strategy.

### Breadth of Experience

20+ years across:
- High-scale SaaS platforms (250M+ monthly requests)
- Revenue-critical systems ($1B+ annual transactions)
- Multiple acquisitions and integrations
- Team growth, Performance Management, Team Topologies, role design, recruiting, onboarding
- Technology transformations (monolith to microservices, digital transformation, cloud migration)
- AI adoption and governance

### Crisis-Tested

When things break at 3 AM and millions in revenue are at risk, you need someone who stays calm and executes. I've recovered from:
- Data center catastrophic failures (24-minute recovery)
- Critical production incidents affecting thousands of users
- Acquisition-driven platform consolidations under tight deadlines
- Cost spirals requiring immediate intervention 

### Pragmatic, Not Dogmatic

I've seen too many "best practices" fail in the real world. I adapt approaches to your context:
- Startup needing to ship fast vs. enterprise requiring compliance
- Greenfield architecture vs. legacy system constraints
- High-trust team vs. team building psychological safety

### Current & Relevant

My fractional CTO work and recent AI portfolio projects keep me current with modern development practices:
- Agentic development tools (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot)
- Edge computing (Cloudflare Workers)
- Modern frameworks (Next.js 16, React 19)
- AI application patterns (RAG, streaming, evaluation)

## How I Work

### Initial Consultation (Week 1)

Free 1-hour conversation to understand your situation:
- What's the immediate challenge or opportunity?
- What does success look like in 3-6 months?

If we're a good fit, I provide a clear proposal with scope, deliverables, and pricing.

### Onboarding (Week 1-2)

I get up to speed quickly:
- Review codebase, architecture, and documentation
- Meet with key team members and stakeholders
- Understand roadmap, priorities, and pain points

- Code/design review as needed
- Monthly retrospectives to assess progress and adjust approach

### Flexible Commitment

Your needs change. Engagements can scale up or down:
