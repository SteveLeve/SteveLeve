### Hi, I'm Steve 👋

**Full-stack technologist who ships products.** 25 years building software that generates revenue, reduces costs, and runs for years. Now AI-enhanced — I build with LLMs, RAG systems, and agentic tools to ship faster and smarter.

I'm an expert generalist: I go deep where needed, see the whole picture, and move fluidly across domains.
