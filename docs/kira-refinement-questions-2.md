**Final Clarifying Questions:**

1. **Question:** Domain Setup: Do you already own the domain you'll use, and do you need help with DNS/Cloudflare setup?

   **Answer:** I own the domain, cloudflare is my registrar, I am familiar with Wrangler deployment.

2. **Question:** Timeline: What's your target timeline for having the production site live? (This will help me prioritize features)

   **Answer:** ASAP, yesterday

3. **Question:** Content Migration: Should we plan to programmatically migrate content from your current static site, or will you manually recreate it in the new structure?

   **Answer:** either, there isn’t very much content. I’d like to be able to export this site to my [steveleve.github.io](http://steveleve.github.io) page if possible \- publishing as a static site ideally. 

4. **Question:** Authentication: For the future client area, any preference for auth providers (Auth0, Clerk, Supabase Auth, or custom)?

   **Answer:** Auth0 or Cognito most likely, but this is not a primary GTM concern. Initially I am using this as a personal website to land a full time role if possible. Only after I have clients will this be a concern.
