# Documentation

This directory contains all architectural, design, and decision records for the project.

---

## Philosophy

- **Intention Before Action**: Document first, then implement.  
- **Living Docs**: Capture *what, why, and how thinking changed*.  
- **AI-Friendly**: Consistent, structured docs that LLM agents can consume.

---

## Structure

- `spec/` — Platform overview, UI specs, functional requirements  
- `adr/` — Architecture decision records (ADR format)  
- `api/` — API schemas, authentication flows  
- `diagrams/` — System, data flow, and deployment diagrams (Mermaid)  
- `DEVELOPMENT-JOURNAL.md` — Log of learnings, changes, intentions  

---

## Workflow

1. Draft spec or ADR before changes  
2. Commit documentation  
3. Implement code aligned to docs  
4. Log lessons in `DEVELOPMENT-JOURNAL.md`
