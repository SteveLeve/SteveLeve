## Description

A dynamic data-flow inspired professional IT services hero banner implemented using canvas & javascript.

### Features & Capabilities

- Dynamic Network Visualization - Perfect metaphor for systems architecture and API integrations
- Particle System - Represents data flow, which aligns with digital transformation
- Interactive Elements - Mouse hover particle attraction, click data bursts
- Material Design Controls - Icon-based theme and animation toggles with hover effects
- Animation Controls - Toggle button to pause/resume animations for accessibility and performance
- Performance Optimizations - Particle pooling, auto-quality adjustment, FPS monitoring
- Responsive Design - Adaptive particle counts, mobile-optimized connections, hardware detection
- Smooth Animations - Professional, modern feel that builds trust
- Theme Adaptability - Seamless dark/light mode switching
- Performance - Hardware accelerated, scales well across devices

### Canvas & Javascript strategy

- Pros: More complex animations, particle systems, real-time effects
- Best for: Network visualizations, data flows, interactive elements
- Performance: Hardware accelerated, smooth 60fps animations

## Roadmap

### Merging Layouts

- import styles and content from index.html into data_flow_canvas_hero.html to demonstrate successful concept integration.
- ensure the hero canvas is behind the page content in z-index so that page content can be selected and interacted with.
- the light/dark mode and animation play/pause controls should be right aligned in the menu bar.  
- once satisfied with the result proceed to apply site wide.
