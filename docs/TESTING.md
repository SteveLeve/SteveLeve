# Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Steve Leve Consulting Website project. Our goal is to ensure a high-quality, reliable, and performant application.

## 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)

This project prefers a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach for all new features and bug fixes. The development workflow should be as follows:

1.  **Write a Failing Test**: Before writing any implementation code, write an automated test that reproduces the bug or defines the new feature. This test should fail.
2.  **Write Code to Pass the Test**: Write the minimum amount of code required to make the test pass.
3.  **Refactor**: Refactor the code to improve its structure, readability, and performance while ensuring the test still passes.

## 2. Types of Testing

### a. Unit & Integration Tests (Vitest)

-   **Framework**: We will use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit and integration testing, as it integrates seamlessly with our Vite-based Astro environment.
-   **Location**: Tests should be located in the same directory as the component or module they are testing, using a `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts` naming convention.
-   **Scope**: All new business logic, UI components, and API endpoints must be accompanied by tests.

### b. End-to-End (E2E) Tests (Playwright)

-   **Framework**: [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is the chosen framework for E2E testing to simulate user interactions and verify critical user flows.
-   **Configuration**: Multi-server setup running both Astro site (port 4321) and API worker (port 8787)
-   **Location**: Tests are located in `workers/site/tests/e2e/` directory
-   **Current Coverage**:
    -   âœ… Contact form display and validation
    -   âœ… Contact form submission (end-to-end workflow)
    -   âœ… React component hydration in Astro
    -   ðŸ”„ Navigation and page rendering (planned)
    -   ðŸ”„ Theme switching (light/dark mode) (planned)
-   **Running E2E Tests**: Use `npm run test:e2e` in the `workers/site` directory

### c. Performance Auditing (Lighthouse)

-   **Tool**: Google Lighthouse will be used to audit performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.
-   **Target**: All pages should maintain a Lighthouse score of **90+** across all categories.
-   **Process**: Audits should be run before and after significant changes to monitor the impact on performance.

### d. Manual & Cross-Browser Testing

-   **Process**: Before a feature is considered complete, it must be manually tested on the latest versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
-   **Scope**: Manual testing should verify:
    -   Responsive design on various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
    -   Accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility).
    -   Correct rendering and functionality.

## 3. Running Tests

### Unit & Integration Tests
To run unit and integration tests, use the following command in the appropriate workspace (`/workers/site` or `/workers/api`):

```bash
npm test
```

### End-to-End Tests
To run Playwright E2E tests, use the following command in the `/workers/site` directory:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

**Note**: E2E tests automatically start both the Astro site and API worker services. Ensure no other services are running on ports 4321 or 8787.

### Test Results
Current test status:
- âœ… Contact form E2E tests: 2/2 passing
- âœ… Multi-server configuration working
- âœ… Full contact form workflow tested
