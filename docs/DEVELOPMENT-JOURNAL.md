## 2025-01-30: Project Initiation and Technology Stack Selection

### Context and Motivation
Started the consulting website modernization project with urgent timeline - need production site ASAP for job applications after recent layoff. This project serves multiple purposes:
- Immediate: Professional web presence for job search
- Medium-term: Consulting business platform
- Learning: Modern DevOps technologies (Terraform, edge computing)

### Key Decisions Made

#### Technology Stack Selection (ADR-001)
After evaluating options, chose Astro + React + Cloudflare Workers stack:

**Why Astro over Next.js/Nuxt?**
- Islands architecture perfect for mostly-static site with selective interactivity
- Excellent performance out of the box (critical for job applications)
- Easy migration path from existing static HTML/CSS
- Strong SEO capabilities

**Why Hono over vanilla Workers?**
- Industry standard for Cloudflare Workers development in 2024
- Excellent TypeScript support and middleware ecosystem
- Performance optimized for edge runtimes
- Better developer experience than raw Workers API

**Why Cloudflare over Vercel/Netlify?**
- Learning objective: want edge computing experience
- Cost effective for personal/small business use
- Integrated Workers + Pages ecosystem
- Terraform support for infrastructure learning

#### Phased Implementation Strategy
Decided on 3-phase approach to balance urgency with learning:

1. **Phase 1 (Week 1)**: Production MVP with Wrangler CLI
   - Astro site with migrated content
   - Contact form with Workers
   - Basic CI/CD with GitHub Actions

2. **Phase 2 (Week 2)**: Infrastructure as Code
   - Terraform modules for all Cloudflare resources
   - Enhanced monitoring and security
   - Staging environment setup

3. **Phase 3 (Future)**: Advanced Features
   - Client authentication portal
   - CMS integration
   - Advanced analytics

### Technical Insights

#### Documentation-Driven Development
Following established workflow from docs/README.md:
- Created comprehensive spec with requirements, design, and tasks
- Captured architectural decisions in ADR format
- This journal to track learning and evolution

#### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Timeline Risk**: Prioritizing MVP over perfect architecture
- **Learning Curve**: Leveraging existing React knowledge for Astro adoption
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Acceptable trade-off for learning objectives and speed

### Next Steps
1. ✅ Execute Task 1: Initialize Astro project with React and TypeScript
2. Focus on tasks 1-13 for rapid production deployment
3. Document learnings and challenges as they arise

## 2025-01-30: Task 1 Completion - Astro Project Initialization

### Context
Completed Task 1: Initialize Astro project with React and TypeScript using Cloudflare's recommended creation method.

### Decisions Made

#### Project Creation Method (ADR-003)
Used `npm create cloudflare@latest -- consulting-website --framework=astro` which provided:
- Pre-configured Cloudflare adapter and deployment settings
- Automatic React integration
- TypeScript configuration optimized for Workers
- Tailwind CSS setup with Vite plugin
- Wrangler configuration for deployment

#### Architecture Clarification (ADR-003)
Clarified framework roles:
- **Astro + React**: Main website framework (current setup)
- **Vite**: Build tool (comes with Astro, not a separate choice)
- **Hono**: Future API Worker for contact forms (separate component)

### Technical Insights

#### Generated Project Structure
```
src/consulting-website/
├── src/
│   ├── layouts/Layout.astro     # Created base layout with Tailwind import
│   ├── pages/index.astro        # Updated with test content
│   ├── components/TestReactComponent.tsx  # React integration test
│   └── styles/global.css        # Tailwind CSS imports
├── astro.config.mjs            # Cloudflare adapter + React integration
├── wrangler.jsonc              # Deployment configuration
├── tsconfig.json               # TypeScript with React JSX support
└── package.json                # All dependencies included
```

#### Key Configuration Highlights
- Cloudflare adapter with platform proxy enabled
- React integration with TypeScript JSX support
- Tailwind CSS via Vite plugin (modern approach)
- Wrangler configured for Workers deployment

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Tailwind Import**: Needed to import `../styles/global.css` in Layout.astro
2. **Architecture Confusion**: Initially unclear about Vite vs Hono roles
3. **Project Structure**: Generated in subdirectory, needed to navigate correctly

### Validation Results
- ✅ Development server runs on `http://localhost:4321/`
- ✅ React components render with state management
- ✅ Tailwind CSS classes apply correctly
- ✅ TypeScript compilation works without errors
- ✅ Cloudflare deployment configuration ready

### Next Steps
1. ✅ Execute Task 2: Create core layout components and navigation
