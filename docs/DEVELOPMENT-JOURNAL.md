## 2025-01-30: Project Initiation and Technology Stack Selection

### Context and Motivation
Started the consulting website modernization project with urgent timeline - need production site ASAP for job applications after recent layoff. This project serves multiple purposes:
- Immediate: Professional web presence for job search
- Medium-term: Consulting business platform
- Learning: Modern DevOps technologies (Terraform, edge computing)

### Key Decisions Made

#### Technology Stack Selection (ADR-001)
After evaluating options, chose Astro + React + Cloudflare Workers stack:

**Why Astro over Next.js/Nuxt?**
- Islands architecture perfect for mostly-static site with selective interactivity
- Excellent performance out of the box (critical for job applications)
- Easy migration path from existing static HTML/CSS
- Strong SEO capabilities

**Why Hono over vanilla Workers?**
- Industry standard for Cloudflare Workers development in 2024
- Excellent TypeScript support and middleware ecosystem
- Performance optimized for edge runtimes
- Better developer experience than raw Workers API

**Why Cloudflare over Vercel/Netlify?**
- Learning objective: want edge computing experience
- Cost effective for personal/small business use
- Integrated Workers + Pages ecosystem
- Terraform support for infrastructure learning

#### Phased Implementation Strategy
Decided on 3-phase approach to balance urgency with learning:

1. **Phase 1 (Week 1)**: Production MVP with Wrangler CLI
   - Astro site with migrated content
   - Contact form with Workers
   - Basic CI/CD with GitHub Actions

2. **Phase 2 (Week 2)**: Infrastructure as Code
   - Terraform modules for all Cloudflare resources
   - Enhanced monitoring and security
   - Staging environment setup

3. **Phase 3 (Future)**: Advanced Features
   - Client authentication portal
   - CMS integration
   - Advanced analytics

### Technical Insights

#### Documentation-Driven Development
Following established workflow from docs/README.md:
- Created comprehensive spec with requirements, design, and tasks
- Captured architectural decisions in ADR format
- This journal to track learning and evolution

#### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Timeline Risk**: Prioritizing MVP over perfect architecture
- **Learning Curve**: Leveraging existing React knowledge for Astro adoption
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Acceptable trade-off for learning objectives and speed

### Next Steps
1. Execute Task 1: Initialize Astro project with React and TypeScript
2. Focus on tasks 1-13 for rapid production deployment
3. Document learnings and challenges as they arise

### Questions for Future Investigation
- Email service selection: Resend vs SendGrid for contact forms
- CMS evaluation: Keystatic vs Sanity for content management
- Authentication strategy: Auth0 vs Cognito for future client portal

### Reflection
The spec creation process helped clarify priorities and technical approach. Having urgent business need (job applications) provides good constraint for avoiding over-engineering while still incorporating learning objectives. The phased approach should allow rapid deployment while building DevOps skills incrementally.
