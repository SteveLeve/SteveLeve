## 2025-01-30: Project Initiation and Technology Stack Selection

### Context and Motivation
Started the consulting website modernization project with urgent timeline - need production site ASAP for job applications after recent layoff. This project serves multiple purposes:
- Immediate: Professional web presence for job search
- Medium-term: Consulting business platform
- Learning: Modern DevOps technologies (Terraform, edge computing)

### Key Decisions Made

#### Technology Stack Selection (ADR-001)
After evaluating options, chose Astro + React + Cloudflare Workers stack:

**Why Astro over Next.js/Nuxt?**
- Islands architecture perfect for mostly-static site with selective interactivity
- Excellent performance out of the box (critical for job applications)
- Easy migration path from existing static HTML/CSS
- Strong SEO capabilities

**Why Hono over vanilla Workers?**
- Industry standard for Cloudflare Workers development in 2024
- Excellent TypeScript support and middleware ecosystem
- Performance optimized for edge runtimes
- Better developer experience than raw Workers API

**Why Cloudflare over Vercel/Netlify?**
- Learning objective: want edge computing experience
- Cost effective for personal/small business use
- Integrated Workers + Pages ecosystem
- Terraform support for infrastructure learning

#### Phased Implementation Strategy
Decided on 3-phase approach to balance urgency with learning:

1. **Phase 1 (Week 1)**: Production MVP with Wrangler CLI
   - Astro site with migrated content
   - Contact form with Workers
   - Basic CI/CD with GitHub Actions

2. **Phase 2 (Week 2)**: Infrastructure as Code
   - Terraform modules for all Cloudflare resources
   - Enhanced monitoring and security
   - Staging environment setup

3. **Phase 3 (Future)**: Advanced Features
   - Client authentication portal
   - CMS integration
   - Advanced analytics

### Technical Insights

#### Documentation-Driven Development
Following established workflow from docs/README.md:
- Created comprehensive spec with requirements, design, and tasks
- Captured architectural decisions in ADR format
- This journal to track learning and evolution

#### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Timeline Risk**: Prioritizing MVP over perfect architecture
- **Learning Curve**: Leveraging existing React knowledge for Astro adoption
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Acceptable trade-off for learning objectives and speed

### Next Steps
1. ✅ Execute Task 1: Initialize Astro project with React and TypeScript
2. Focus on tasks 1-13 for rapid production deployment
3. Document learnings and challenges as they arise

## 2025-01-30: Task 1 Completion - Astro Project Initialization

### Context
Completed Task 1: Initialize Astro project with React and TypeScript using Cloudflare's recommended creation method.

### Decisions Made

#### Project Creation Method (ADR-003)
Used `npm create cloudflare@latest -- consulting-website --framework=astro` which provided:
- Pre-configured Cloudflare adapter and deployment settings
- Automatic React integration
- TypeScript configuration optimized for Workers
- Tailwind CSS setup with Vite plugin
- Wrangler configuration for deployment

#### Architecture Clarification (ADR-003)
Clarified framework roles:
- **Astro + React**: Main website framework (current setup)
- **Vite**: Build tool (comes with Astro, not a separate choice)
- **Hono**: Future API Worker for contact forms (separate component)

### Technical Insights

#### Generated Project Structure
```
src/consulting-website/
├── src/
│   ├── layouts/Layout.astro     # Created base layout with Tailwind import
│   ├── pages/index.astro        # Updated with test content
│   ├── components/TestReactComponent.tsx  # React integration test
│   └── styles/global.css        # Tailwind CSS imports
├── astro.config.mjs            # Cloudflare adapter + React integration
├── wrangler.jsonc              # Deployment configuration
├── tsconfig.json               # TypeScript with React JSX support
└── package.json                # All dependencies included
```

#### Key Configuration Highlights
- Cloudflare adapter with platform proxy enabled
- React integration with TypeScript JSX support
- Tailwind CSS via Vite plugin (modern approach)
- Wrangler configured for Workers deployment

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Tailwind Import**: Needed to import `../styles/global.css` in Layout.astro
2. **Architecture Confusion**: Initially unclear about Vite vs Hono roles
3. **Project Structure**: Generated in subdirectory, needed to navigate correctly

### Validation Results
- ✅ Development server runs on `http://localhost:4321/`
- ✅ React components render with state management
- ✅ Tailwind CSS classes apply correctly
- ✅ TypeScript compilation works without errors
- ✅ Cloudflare deployment configuration ready

### Next Steps
1. ✅ Execute Task 2: Create core layout components and navigation
2. Begin content migration from static site
3. Test deployment pipeline early

- CSS-in-JS for component-scoped styles
- Minimal JavaScript for theme switching
- Astro islands architecture for optimal hydration

### Challenges Encountered
1. **CSS Custom Properties**: Needed to use `:global()` directive in Astro for theme variables
2. **Material Icons**: Required proper font loading and variation settings
3. **Mobile Navigation**: Balanced between Astro static generation and React interactivity
4. **Theme Persistence**: Implemented localStorage with SSR considerations

### Validation Results

- ✅ Animated background renders and performs well
- ✅ Service cards display with proper hover effects
- ✅ Navigation links work (404s expected for unbuilt pages)
- ✅ Responsive design adapts across breakpoints
- ✅ Theme switching works across all components
- ✅ Animation toggle controls background animation

### Content Accuracy
Verified exact migration of:
- Hero messaging and CTAs
- Service pillar descriptions and icons
- Workshop project details
- Call-to-action copy
- Visual design consistency with original

### Bug Fix: Theme Toggle Functionality
**Issue**: Theme switching was not working - button was present but not functional
**Root Cause**: Theme toggle button was in Header.astro (static) but JavaScript logic was in unused Navigation.tsx (React)
**Solution**: Added proper theme switching JavaScript directly to Header.astro component
**Implementation**:
- Added theme initialization from localStorage and system preferences
- Implemented toggle functionality with proper icon updates
- Added system theme change listener for automatic updates
- Included Astro page-load event listener for SPA-like navigation

### Validation Results
- ✅ Theme toggle button now functional
- ✅ Icon updates correctly (light_mode ↔ dark_mode)
- ✅ Theme persists in localStorage
- ✅ System preference detection works
- ✅ All components respond to theme changes

### Next Steps
1. Execute Task 4: Implement services and case studies pages
2. Create remaining page templates
3. Add content collections for structured data management

### Questions for Future Investigation
- Email service selection: Resend vs SendGrid for contact forms
- CMS evaluation: Keystatic vs Sanity for content management
- Authentication strategy: Auth0 vs Cognito for future client portal

### Reflection
The spec creation process helped clarify priorities and technical approach. Having urgent business need (job applications) provides good constraint for avoiding over-engineering while still incorporating learning objectives. The phased approach should allow rapid deployment while building DevOps skills incrementally.
