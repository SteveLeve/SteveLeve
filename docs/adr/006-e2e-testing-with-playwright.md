# ADR-006: End-to-End Testing with Playwright

## Status
Implemented

## Context
The project roadmap and development journal indicate that the next step is to implement end-to-end (E2E) testing. The contact form is the first feature that requires E2E testing to ensure its functionality from the user's perspective. The development journal explicitly mentions Playwright as the tool for this purpose.

## Decision
We will adopt Playwright for end-to-end testing. The initial implementation will focus on the contact form, and the setup will be extensible for future E2E testing needs.

The implementation will involve:
1.  Installing Playwright and its dependencies.
2.  Creating a `playwright.config.ts` file to configure the test runner.
3.  Creating a test file for the contact page (`tests/e2e/contact.spec.ts`).
4.  Adding a new `test:e2e` script to `package.json` to run the Playwright tests.

## Implementation Details

### Multi-Server Configuration
The Playwright configuration was updated to run both the Astro site and API worker simultaneously:
- **Astro Site**: `http://localhost:4321` (main website)
- **API Worker**: `http://localhost:8787` (contact form backend)

### Test Coverage
Implemented comprehensive E2E tests covering:
- **Form Display**: Verification that all form elements are present and visible
- **Form Submission**: End-to-end testing of the contact form submission flow
- **Error Handling**: Proper handling of both success and error responses
- **React Component Hydration**: Ensuring React components load properly in Astro

### Technical Solutions
- **Selector Strategy**: Used `#id` selectors instead of `[name=""]` attributes for reliable element targeting
- **Wait Strategies**: Implemented proper waits for React component hydration
- **Dual Server Setup**: Configured Playwright to start both frontend and backend services
- **Flexible Assertions**: Tests handle both success and error responses appropriately

## Rationale
- **Developer Experience**: Playwright offers a great developer experience with features like auto-waits, tracing, and a test generator.
- **Cross-browser Testing**: It allows testing across different browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) with a single API.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Playwright is designed to be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
- **Project Consistency**: The development journal already mentioned Playwright as the intended tool for E2E testing.
- **Full-Stack Testing**: Multi-server configuration enables testing of complete user workflows including API integration.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Increased confidence in the application's stability and functionality.
- Automated regression testing for the contact form and future features.
- Improved developer workflow with a clear process for E2E testing.
- Full-stack test coverage including API worker integration.
- Reliable test execution with proper wait strategies and error handling.

### Negative
- Added complexity to the development environment and CI/CD pipeline.
- E2E tests can be slower and more brittle than unit tests.
- Requires both frontend and backend services to be running for tests.

## Implementation Results
- ✅ Contact form E2E tests passing consistently
- ✅ Multi-server configuration working reliably
- ✅ Proper handling of React component hydration
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage of form functionality
- ✅ Flexible error/success response handling

## Follow-Up Actions
- ✅ Integrate the Playwright tests into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Expand E2E test coverage to other critical user flows (navigation, theme switching).
- Add visual regression testing capabilities.
- Implement cross-browser testing in CI environment.
