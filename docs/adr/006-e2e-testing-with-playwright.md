# ADR-006: End-to-End Testing with Playwright

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The project roadmap and development journal indicate that the next step is to implement end-to-end (E2E) testing. The contact form is the first feature that requires E2E testing to ensure its functionality from the user's perspective. The development journal explicitly mentions Playwright as the tool for this purpose.

## Decision
We will adopt Playwright for end-to-end testing. The initial implementation will focus on the contact form, and the setup will be extensible for future E2E testing needs.

The implementation will involve:
1.  Installing Playwright and its dependencies.
2.  Creating a `playwright.config.ts` file to configure the test runner.
3.  Creating a test file for the contact page (`tests/e2e/contact.spec.ts`).
4.  Adding a new `test:e2e` script to `package.json` to run the Playwright tests.

## Rationale
- **Developer Experience**: Playwright offers a great developer experience with features like auto-waits, tracing, and a test generator.
- **Cross-browser Testing**: It allows testing across different browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) with a single API.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Playwright is designed to be easily integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
- **Project Consistency**: The development journal already mentioned Playwright as the intended tool for E2E testing.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Increased confidence in the application's stability and functionality.
- Automated regression testing for the contact form and future features.
- Improved developer workflow with a clear process for E2E testing.

### Negative
- Added complexity to the development environment and CI/CD pipeline.
- E2E tests can be slower and more brittle than unit tests.

## Follow-Up Actions
- Integrate the Playwright tests into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Expand E2E test coverage to other critical user flows.
