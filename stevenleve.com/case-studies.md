## From Strategy to Execution

Real-world examples of how pragmatic, reliability-first thinking solves critical business challenges.

### Case Studies

#### Data Center Exit Under Austerity

*   **Challenge:** After an acquisition, we had 12 months to exit a closing data center housing our core revenue-generating systems. The infrastructure was a mix of physical servers and legacy code with minimal documentation.
*   **Action:** I led the reverse-engineering, documentation, and migration of all critical systems to a VMware private cloud. This involved a P2V strategy, automated deployment scripting, and contingency planning to ensure business continuity.
*   **Result:** Completed the migration ahead of schedule with **zero revenue loss**. We transformed undocumented, high-risk hardware into manageable, virtualized assets, paving the way for a future AWS migration.

#### AWS Migration & Modernization

*   **Challenge:** Our managed hosting provider had become a performance bottleneck. We needed to migrate the entire platform to AWS within 6 months to reduce risk and enable modernization.
*   **Action:** I planned and executed a "lift and shift" migration, managing external consultants, redesigning our observability stack for the cloud, and performing targeted refactoring of legacy code to remove blockers.
*   **Result:** We completed the migration to AWS in under 6 months with **zero downtime**. The move unlocked new capabilities and was featured in an AWS case study.

#### Platform Consolidation & Revenue Protection

*   **Challenge:** A multi-year initiative to merge two major MarTech platforms required integrating a legacy tracking system—responsible for 250M monthly requests—without any customer impact.
*   **Action:** I co-designed a multi-layer reverse proxy architecture using Cloudflare Workers and AWS Lambda. This solution intelligently routed traffic, provided seamless failover, and required zero re-integration from customers.
*   **Result:** We protected **99.5% of channel revenue** while migrating the legacy system. The new cloud-native architecture reduced error rates by **75%** and ensured forward compatibility.
