## Pragmatic Solutions for Complex Challenges

I offer a range of services, from fixed-fee assessments to hands-on custom engagements, designed to deliver measurable value and build your team's capabilities.

### Productized Offerings (Fixed-Fee)

*These are focused, rapid engagements designed to give you clarity and an actionable plan in a short amount of time.*

*   **AI Prototype Sprint:** A 2-week engagement to build a functional Proof of Concept (PoC) for your specific AI use case (e.g., RAG chatbot, document processor). Includes architecture design and code handover.
*   **Agentic Coding Enablement:** A workshop and toolkit to help your engineering team adopt AI-assisted development. Includes context engineering patterns (`CLAUDE.md`), tool selection guidance, and safety protocols (DevContainers).
*   **Technology Risk & Modernization Assessment:** A comprehensive review of your current architecture, identifying key risks, performance bottlenecks, and opportunities for pragmatic modernization.
*   **Reliability & Incident Response Audit:** An evaluation of your monitoring, alerting, and on-call processes to reduce MTTR and build a resilient culture.

### Custom Engagements

*For more complex, long-term challenges, I partner with you as a hybrid advisor and hands-on contributor.*

*   **AI Engineering & Strategy:**
    *   **What it is:** End-to-end development of production AI applications. From selecting the right LLMs and vector databases to building the API and frontend.
    *   **Best for:** Companies wanting to integrate AI features but lacking internal expertise in RAG, embeddings, or prompt engineering.

*   **Agentic Workflow Design (DX + AI):**
    *   **What it is:** I help you design and implement "Context Engineering" standards that make your codebase AI-ready. I define agent personas, create structured context documents, and optimize developer workflows for 2-3x velocity gains.
    *   **Best for:** Engineering leaders who want to maximize the ROI of tools like Copilot and Claude while maintaining code quality.

*   **Trusted Advisor (Fractional CTO/Architect):**
    *   **What it is:** Ongoing, part-time guidance for your leadership and engineering teams. I provide architectural reviews, mentor senior engineers, and help you build a long-term technical vision.
    *   **Best for:** Startups and SMBs that need senior technical leadership but aren't ready for a full-time executive hire.

*   **Troubleshooting & Problem Solving:**
    *   **What it is:** Deep, hands-on engagement to resolve a persistent or critical technical issue (outages, performance bottlenecks, security incidents).
    *   **Best for:** Teams facing recurring stability issues they can't solve.

*   **Roadmapping & Technical Strategy:**
    *   **What it is:** Collaborative sessions to define the future state of your architecture and create a phased, realistic plan to get there.
    *   **Best for:** Businesses planning a cloud migration, monolith decomposition, or major re-platforming initiative.
