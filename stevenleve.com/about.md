# About Me

## 25+ Years of Engineering Evolution

From building foundational infrastructure to architecting the next generation of AI applications. I bring a depth of experience that ensures innovation is built on a solid, reliable foundation.

### My Story

My career has been defined by adaptation and solving the hardest problems in the room. For over two decades, I built and scaled the infrastructure that powers the web—navigating data center exits, cloud migrations, and massive scale. I learned that reliability isn't just about uptime; it's about trust.

In 2025, I recognized a paradigm shift. The same engineering rigor I applied to SRE and platform engineering was now critically needed in the emerging field of AI. I pivoted my focus to AI Engineering, applying my deep background in distributed systems and data pipelines to build production-grade AI applications.

But I didn't leave my past behind. I brought it with me. My experience leading large-scale platform migrations and AI governance initiatives allows me to see the bigger picture. I don't just write AI code; I help organizations build the *context* for AI to succeed. I've spent months exploring agentic coding environments, defining "Context Engineering" patterns that allow developers to work 3-5x faster without sacrificing quality.

### What I'm Known For

*   **Bias for Action:** I don't just plan; I build. In a single month, I architected and shipped three production-quality projects, demonstrating that speed and quality can coexist.

*   **Deep Technical Roots:** My AI work is grounded in 17+ years of platform engineering. I understand the full stack—from the GPU hardware to the React frontend—and how to optimize every layer.

*   **Agentic Workflow Expert:** I help teams responsibly adopt AI-assisted coding. I design the "Context Engineering" standards—like `CLAUDE.md` and structured data files—that turn generic AI tools into specialized domain experts.

*   **Mentorship & Team Growth:** I continue to believe that great software is built by great teams. I'm passionate about upskilling engineers and helping them navigate the rapidly changing technology landscape.

### Recent Highlights

*   **Built a Production RAG Application:** Architected a full-stack system with sub-second latency, integrating multiple LLM providers and vector search.
*   **Open-Sourced LLM Benchmarking:** Created a framework to analyze Intel GPU performance for local inference, helping the community make informed hardware decisions.
*   **Secured Edge Infrastructure:** Deployed a consulting platform on Cloudflare Workers with a 96% security score, demonstrating "secure by design" principles.
*   **AWS Certified AI Practitioner:** Validated expertise in the AWS AI ecosystem (2025-2028).
